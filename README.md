# Basic Java Calculator

This is my **first Java project**: a simple calculator built using the `Scanner` class for user input.  
It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Takes user input for numbers and operators.
- Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Can handle multiple numbers step by step using a loop.
- Designed for learning and practicing Java fundamentals.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many numbers they want to calculate.
2. The user enters the first number.
3. The program then asks for an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and the next number.
4. Steps 2-3 repeat until all numbers are entered.
5. The program displays the final result.

## Example Run
How many numbers do you want to enter? 3
Enter number 1: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter number 2: 5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter number 3: 2
Result: 30
## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.
2. Compile the program:
3. Run the program:
4. Follow the prompts to perform calculations.

## Learning Outcomes

- Using `Scanner` for user input.
- Implementing loops for multiple inputs.
- Using `if-else` and `switch` statements.
- Handling errors like division by zero.


This project is part of my journey to **practice Java programming** and understand basic programming concepts in a real-world scenario.
If you want, I can also make a version for your GUI calculator with buttons and JLabel, so you have two separate READMEs: one for console-based and one for GUI-based.
